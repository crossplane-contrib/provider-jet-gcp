                      is intended to act strictly as a grouping mechanism for the
                      attached Occurrences (Attestations). This grouping mechanism
                      also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the ability
                      for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given Note. It
                      also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                      Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the
                      same project.

                            about the purpose of the AttestationAuthority. Because
                            the name of a Note acts as its resource reference, it
                            is important to disambiguate the canonical name of the
                            Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes) from
                            "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note
