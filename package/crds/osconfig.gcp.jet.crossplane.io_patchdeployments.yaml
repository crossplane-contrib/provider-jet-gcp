                            number of VMs in a zone is rounded up. During patching,
                            a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is
                            notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption
                            time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch
                            steps. A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its
                            patching operation fails either when applying the patches,
                            running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond
                            with a success notification before timing out. VMs that
                            are not running or do not have an active agent do not
                            count toward this disruption budget. For zone-by-zone
                            rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded,
                            the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone
                            requires completion of the patch process in the previous
                            zone. For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed
                            value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone,
                            the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until
                            the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully,
                            patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone.
                            If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job
                            stops.
