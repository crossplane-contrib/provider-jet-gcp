                                        X.509 extension. For a CA certificate, this
                                        value describes the depth of subordinate CA
                                        certificates that are allowed. If this value
                                        is less than 0, the request will fail. If
                                        this value is missing, the max path length
                                        will be omitted from the CA certificate.
