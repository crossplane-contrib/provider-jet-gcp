                to the service specified by serviceName field. A single MethodSelector

            perimeter_type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.
            permission: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Value for permission should be a valid Cloud IAM permission for the
                corresponding serviceName in ApiOperation.
            resource: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A Google Cloud resource that is allowed to ingress the perimeter.
                Requests from these resources will be allowed to access perimeter data.
                Currently only projects are allowed. Format projects/{project_number}
                The project may be in any Google Cloud organization, not just the
                organization that the perimeter is defined in. * is not allowed, the case
                of allowing all Google Cloud resources only is not supported.
            resources: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of resources, currently only projects in the form
                projects/<projectnumber>, that match this to stanza. A request matches
                if it contains a resource in this list. If * is specified for resources,
                then this EgressTo rule will authorize access to all resources outside
                the perimeter.
            restricted_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter
                restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if
                storage.googleapis.com is specified, access to the storage
                buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access
                restrictions.
            service_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the API whose methods or permissions the IngressPolicy or
                EgressPolicy want to allow. A single ApiOperation with serviceName
                field set to * will allow all methods AND permissions for all services.
            sources: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Sources that this IngressPolicy authorizes access from.
                Structure is documented below.
            spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Proposed (or dry run) ServicePerimeter configuration.
                This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration
                without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when
                the useExplicitDryRunSpec flag is set.
                Structure is documented below.
            status: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                ServicePerimeter configuration. Specifies sets of resources,
                restricted services and access levels that determine
                perimeter content and boundaries.
                Structure is documented below.

            use_explicit_dry_run_spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

            perimeter_type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.
                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.
                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.
                Default value is PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR.
                Possible values are PERIMETER_TYPE_REGULAR and PERIMETER_TYPE_BRIDGE.
            permission: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Value for permission should be a valid Cloud IAM permission for the
                corresponding serviceName in ApiOperation.
            resource: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A Google Cloud resource that is allowed to ingress the perimeter.
                Requests from these resources will be allowed to access perimeter data.
                Currently only projects are allowed. Format projects/{project_number}
                The project may be in any Google Cloud organization, not just the
                organization that the perimeter is defined in. * is not allowed, the case
                of allowing all Google Cloud resources only is not supported.
            resources: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of resources, currently only projects in the form
                projects/<projectnumber>, that match this to stanza. A request matches
                if it contains a resource in this list. If * is specified for resources,
                then this EgressTo rule will authorize access to all resources outside
                the perimeter.
            restricted_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter
                restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if
                storage.googleapis.com is specified, access to the storage
                buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access
                restrictions.
            service_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the API whose methods or permissions the IngressPolicy or
                EgressPolicy want to allow. A single ApiOperation with serviceName
                field set to * will allow all methods AND permissions for all services.
            service_perimeters: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The desired Service Perimeters that should replace all existing Service Perimeters in the Access Policy.

                -
                (Optional)
                Proposed (or dry run) ServicePerimeter configuration.
                This configuration allows to specify and test ServicePerimeter configuration
                without enforcing actual access restrictions. Only allowed to be set when
                the useExplicitDryRunSpec flag is set.
                Structure is documented below.
            status: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                ServicePerimeter configuration. Specifies sets of resources,
                restricted services and access levels that determine
                perimeter content and boundaries.

            use_explicit_dry_run_spec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
                for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
                bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                (Optional)
                ID of the AuthorizedCertificate resource configuring SSL for the application. Clearing this field will
                remove SSL support.
                By default, a managed certificate is automatically created for every domain mapping. To omit SSL support
                or to configure SSL manually, specify SslManagementType.MANUAL on a CREATE or UPDATE request. You must be
                authorized to administer the AuthorizedCertificate resource to manually map it to a DomainMapping resource.

                managed certificate has been successfully provisioned, the previous SSL state will be preserved. Once the
                provisioning process completes, the certificateId field will reflect the new managed certificate and this
                field will be left empty. To remove SSL support while there is still a pending managed certificate, clear the
                certificateId field with an update request.

                By default, the rollout strategy for Endpoints is "FIXED". This means that Endpoints starts up with a particular configuration ID.
                When a new configuration is rolled out, Endpoints must be given the new configuration ID. The configId field is used to give the configuration ID
                and is required in this case.
                Endpoints also has a rollout strategy called "MANAGED". When using this, Endpoints fetches the latest configuration and does not need
                the configuration ID. In this case, configId must be omitted.

                Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported:
                CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table.
                CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion
                Default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED.

            errors: |-
                -
                The first errors encountered during the running of the job. The final message
                includes the number of errors that caused the process to stop. Errors here do
                not necessarily mean that the job has not completed or was unsuccessful.
                Structure is documented below.
            expiration_ms: |-

                -
                (Optional)
                When extracting data in CSV format, this defines the delimiter to use between fields in the exported data.
                Default is ','
            flatten_results: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results.
                allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For standard SQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.
            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/jobs/{{job_id}}'
            ignore_unknown_values: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema.
                If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records,
                and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
                The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:
                CSV: Trailing columns
                JSON: Named values that don't match any column names
            inline_code: |-

                (Optional)
                The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value,
                an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid.
            maximum_billing_tier: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                (Optional)
                Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as a null value
                when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an
                empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as
                an empty value.
            parameter_mode: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                If sourceFormat is set to "DATASTORE_BACKUP", indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup.
                Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties.
                If any named property isn't found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.
            query: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Configures a query job.

            quote: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding,
                and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state.
                The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.
                If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true.

            schema_update_options: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or
                supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND;
                when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators.
                For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:
                ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
                ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.

                -
                (Optional)
                The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
            source_format: |-
                -

                Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported:
                WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the table data and uses the schema from the query result.
                WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
                WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
                Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully.
                Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.
                Default value is WRITE_EMPTY.
                Possible values are WRITE_TRUNCATE, WRITE_APPEND, and WRITE_EMPTY.

                require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be
                specified.
            schema: |-
                - (Optional) A JSON schema for the external table. Schema is required
                for CSV and JSON formats if autodetect is not on. Schema is disallowed
                for Google Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Datastore backups, Avro, ORC and Parquet formats.
                ~>NOTE: Because this field expects a JSON string, any changes to the
                string will create a diff, even if the JSON itself hasn't changed.
                Furthermore drift for this field cannot not be detected because BigQuery
                only uses this schema to compute the effective schema for the table, therefore
                any changes on the configured value will force the table to be recreated.
                This schema is effectively only applied when creating a table from an external
                datasource, after creation the computed schema will be stored in
                google_bigquery_table.schema
            self_link: '- The URI of the created resource.'
            skip_leading_rows: |-

            source_uri_prefix: |-
                (Optional) - When hive partition detection is requested,
                a common for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately
                before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following
                this data layout. gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro
                gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro When hive
                partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix
                can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/.
                Note that when mode is set to CUSTOM, you must encode the partition key schema within the source_uri_prefix by setting source_uri_prefix to gs://bucket/path_to_table/{key1:TYPE1}/{key2:TYPE2}/{key3:TYPE3}.

                App instance.
                By default, the task is sent to an instance which is available when the task is attempted.
            location: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The location of the queue
            max_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Number of attempts per task.
                Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
                the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
                retries). Must be >= -1.
                If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
                the default.
                -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
            max_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
                maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
                specifies that the task should be retried.
            max_burst_size: |-
                -
                The max burst size.
                Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
                in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
                rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
                resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.
            max_concurrent_dispatches: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to
                be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been
                reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
                concurrent requests decreases.
            max_dispatches_per_second: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.
                If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
            max_doublings: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.
                A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
                then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
                up to maxAttempts times.
            max_retry_duration: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
                retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
                attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
                been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
                made and the task will be deleted.
                If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
            min_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
                maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
                specifies that the task should be retried.
            name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The queue name.

                (Optional)
                Settings that determine the retry behavior.
                Structure is documented below.
            sampling_ratio: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the fraction of operations to write to Stackdriver Logging.
                This field may contain any value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. 0.0 is the
                default and means that no operations are logged.
            service: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                App service.
                By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.

                some of the space will be used by the operating system and build utilities.
                Also note that this is the minimum disk size that will be allocated for the build --
                the build may run with a larger disk than requested. At present, the maximum disk size
                is 1000GB; builds that request more than the maximum are rejected with an error.

                and includedFiles is empty, then as far as this filter is concerned, we
                should trigger the build.
                If any of the files altered in the commit pass the ignoredFiles filter
                and includedFiles is not empty, then we make sure that at least one of
                those files matches a includedFiles glob. If not, then we do not trigger
                a build.

                -
                (Required)
                The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            cooldown_period: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.

            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

            self_link: '- The URI of the created resource.'
            single_instance_assignment: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.

                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable
                ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
            enforcing_consecutive_gateway_failure: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
                of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
                instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
                the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.

                (Optional)
                Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
                After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
                provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
                snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                the disk.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
                you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

                -
                (Optional)
                Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
                field when creating a persistent disk using the image or
                snapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with image or snapshot,
                the value must not be less than the size of the image
                or the size of the snapshot.
                ~>NOTE If you change the size, Terraform updates the disk size
                if upsizing is detected but recreates the disk if downsizing is requested.
                You can add lifecycle.prevent_destroy in the config to prevent destroying
                and recreating.
            snapshot: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
                a partial or full URL to the resource. If the snapshot is in another
                project than this disk, you must supply a full URL. For example, the
                following are valid values:
            source_image_encryption_key: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if

            source_image_id: |-
                -
                The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was used.

                -
                (Optional)
                The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
                if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
                key.
                Structure is documented below.
            source_snapshot_id: |-
                -
                The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
                identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
                disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
                used.

                Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

            ports: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An optional list of ports to which this rule applies. This field
                is only applicable for UDP or TCP protocol. Each entry must be
                either an integer or a range. If not specified, this rule
                applies to connections through any port.
                Example inputs include: ["22"], ["80","443"], and
                ["12345-12349"].
            priority: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
                inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
                priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
                priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
                higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
                precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.

                The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is
                required when creating a firewall rule. This value can either be
                one of the following well known protocol strings (tcp, udp,
                icmp, esp, ah, sctp, ipip, all), or the IP protocol number.

            source_ranges: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
                traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
                be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
                sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
                connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
                apply. Only IPv4 is supported.
            source_service_accounts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only
                to traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this
                list. Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an
                instance's external IP address because service accounts are associated
                with an instance, not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the
                same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If both are set, the firewall will
                apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
                source IP belongs to an instance with service account listed in
                sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
                properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be
                used at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
            source_tags: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
                with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
                tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
                address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
                address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
                both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
                source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
                a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
                to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
            target_service_accounts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the
                network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
                targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or
                sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are
                specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on the specified
                network.
            target_tags: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the
                network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
                If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all
                instances on the specified network.

                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
                For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
                Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
            ip_protocol: |-
                -

                When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, only TCP and UDP are
                valid.
                Possible values are TCP, UDP, ESP, AH, SCTP, ICMP, and L3_DEFAULT.

                Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used
                as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
                instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic
                mirrored even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This
                can only be set to true for load balancers that have their

                This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
                EXTERNAL, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
                Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
                and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
                INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
                and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
                INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.
                Default value is EXTERNAL.
                Possible values are EXTERNAL, INTERNAL, and INTERNAL_MANAGED.
            name: |-

                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
                created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
                RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
                TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
                TargetPool, TargetInstance.
                Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
                addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
                Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
                disjoint port ranges.
                Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
                ports:
            ports: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
                load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
                and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.
                A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
                Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
                configured with this forwarding rule.
                You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
                The three are mutually exclusive.
                You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.

                -
                (Optional)
                The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
                traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
                the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
                loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
                type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
                to IP address specifications.
                An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
                reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
                reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.
                The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
                that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

                (Optional)
                This signifies what the GlobalForwardingRule will be used for.
                The value of INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED means that this will be used for
                Internal Global HTTP(S) LB. The value of EXTERNAL means that this
                will be used for External Global Load Balancing (HTTP(S) LB,
                External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy)
                (Beta only) Note: This field must be set "" if the global address is
                configured as a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and addressType of INTERNAL.

                Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
                configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
                requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
                match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available
                to those proxies.
                For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set
                to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
                corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
                is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
                corresponding labels in the provided metadata.
                metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in
                the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.
                metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their

                - The IP CIDR range represented by this alias IP range. This IP CIDR range
                must belong to the specified subnetwork and cannot contain IP addresses reserved by
                system or used by other network interfaces. This range may be a single IP address
                (e.g. 10.2.3.4), a netmask (e.g. /24) or a CIDR format string (e.g. 10.1.2.0/24).
            ipv6_access_config: |-
                - (Optional) An array of IPv6 access configurations for this interface.
                Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig
                specified, then this instance will have no external IPv6 Internet access. Structure documented below.
            ipv6_access_type: |-
                - One of EXTERNAL, INTERNAL to indicate whether the IP can be accessed from the Internet.
                This field is always inherited from its subnetwork.
            key: '- (Required) Corresponds to the label key of a reservation resource. To target a SPECIFIC_RESERVATION by name, specify compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name as the key and specify the name of your reservation as the only value.'

                - (Optional) The self_link of the encryption key that is
                stored in Google Cloud KMS to encrypt this disk. Only one of kms_key_self_link
                and disk_encryption_key_raw may be set.
            label_fingerprint: '- The unique fingerprint of the labels.'
            labels: '- (Optional) A map of key/value label pairs to assign to the instance.'

                - (Optional) An alternative to using the
                startup-script metadata key, except this one forces the instance to be recreated
                (thus re-running the script) if it is changed. This replaces the startup-script
                metadata key on the created instance and thus the two mechanisms are not
                allowed to be used simultaneously.  Users are free to use either mechanism - the
                only distinction is that this separate attribute will cause a recreate on
                modification.  On import, metadata_startup_script will not be set - if you
                choose to specify it you will see a diff immediately after import causing a
                destroy/recreate operation. If importing an instance and specifying this value
                is desired, you will need to modify your state file manually using
                terraform state commands.

                (Optional)
                Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this interconnect
                attachment:
                NONE is the default value, which means that the attachment carries
                unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to, or receive traffic
                from, this type of attachment.
                IPSEC indicates that the attachment carries only traffic encrypted by
                an IPsec device such as an HA VPN gateway. VMs cannot directly send
                traffic to, or receive traffic from, such an attachment. To use
                IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect create the attachment using this
                option.
                Not currently available publicly.
                Default value is NONE.

                attachment, Used only for interconnect attachment that has the
                encryption option as IPSEC.
                The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
                VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
                configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
                address will be allocated from the IP address range specified
                here.
                For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
                interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN
                gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified
                for this interconnect attachment.
                If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
                encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on
                this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will be
                allocated from regional external IP address pool.

                define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
                customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.
                If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
                on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
                Structure is documented below.
            cooldown_period: |-

                The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
                starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
                the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
                initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
                reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
                Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
                numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
                instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
                and time the startup process.

            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                is exporting per-instance or per-group data.
                You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                any functions for each selector.
                You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                be identical.
                The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                labels.
                If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.
                If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.
                You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

                (Optional)
                Scaling schedules defined for an autoscaler. Multiple schedules can be set on an autoscaler and they can overlap.
                Structure is documented below.
            schedule: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The start timestamps of time intervals when this scaling schedule should provide a scaling signal. This field uses the extended cron format (with an optional year field).
            self_link: '- The URI of the created resource.'
            single_instance_assignment: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                to group resizing.
                For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages
                or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                your instances.
                A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                instead.
            target: |-

                balancing configuration) that autoscaler should maintain. Must
                be a positive float value. If not defined, the default is 0.8.
            time_window_sec: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                to include directives regarding slower scale down, as described above.
            time_zone: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The time zone to be used when interpreting the schedule. The value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database.

                If set to DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, the existing connections persist on
                unhealthy backends only for connection-oriented protocols (TCP and SCTP)
                and only if the Tracking Mode is PER_CONNECTION (default tracking mode)
                or the Session Affinity is configured for 5-tuple. They do not persist
                for UDP.
                If set to NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes unhealthy, the existing
                connections on the unhealthy backend are never persisted on the unhealthy
                backend. They are always diverted to newly selected healthy backends
                (unless all backends are unhealthy).
                If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections always persist on
                unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session affinity. It is
                generally not recommended to use this mode overriding the default.
                Default value is DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL.
                Possible values are DEFAULT_FOR_PROTOCOL, NEVER_PERSIST, and ALWAYS_PERSIST.

                -
                (Optional)
                Number of errors before a host is ejected from the connection pool. When the
                backend host is accessed over HTTP, a 5xx return code qualifies as an error.
                Defaults to 5.
            consecutive_gateway_failure: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of consecutive gateway failures (502, 503, 504 status or connection
                errors that are mapped to one of those status codes) before a consecutive
                gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5.
            consistent_hash: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to provide soft session
                affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
                policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
                destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
                destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
                hashing.
                This field only applies when all of the following are true -
            create: '- Default is 4 minutes.'
            creation_timestamp: |-
                -
                Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses
                that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age).
            delete: '- Default is 4 minutes.'
            description: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An optional description of this resource.
                Provide this property when you create the resource.
            disable_connection_drain_on_failover: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection drain
                will be honored. Setting this to true has the following effect: connections
                to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool
                use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false has the
                following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout
                of 10 min.
                This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP.
                The default is false.
            drop_traffic_if_unhealthy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary
                and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When
                set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group.
                The default is false.
            enable: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to enable logging for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service.

                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through consecutive 5xx. This setting can be used to disable
                ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
            enforcing_consecutive_gateway_failure: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through consecutive gateway failures. This setting can be
                used to disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 0.
            enforcing_success_rate: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The percentage chance that a host will be actually ejected when an outlier
                status is detected through success rate statistics. This setting can be used to
                disable ejection or to ramp it up slowly. Defaults to 100.
            failover: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More
                than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.
            failover_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Policy for failovers.

            failover_ratio: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy
                VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving
                at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend.
                In case where 'failoverRatio' is not set or all the VMs in the backup
                backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary
                backend in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy
                VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy.
                This field is only used with l4 load balancing.
            fingerprint: |-
                -
                Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this
                object. This field is used in optimistic locking.
            group: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
                of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
                instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
                the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.
                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.
                Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
                Network Endpoint Group backends.
                When the load_balancing_scheme is INTERNAL, only instance groups
                are supported.
                Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.

                A health check must be specified unless the backend service uses an internet
                or serverless NEG as a backend.
            http_cookie: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie
                that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load
                balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated.
                This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE.

                according to query_string_whitelist and
                query_string_blacklist. If neither is set, the entire query
                string will be included.
                If false, the query string will be excluded from the cache
                key entirely.

                Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request
                will be considered fresh, defaults to 1hr (3600s). After this
                time period, the response will be revalidated before
                being served.
                When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
                internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
                "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
                existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in

            success_rate_minimum_hosts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The number of hosts in a cluster that must have enough request volume to detect
                success rate outliers. If the number of hosts is less than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for any host in the
                cluster. Defaults to 5.

                (Optional)
                The minimum number of total requests that must be collected in one interval (as
                defined by the interval duration above) to include this host in success rate
                based outlier detection. If the volume is lower than this setting, outlier
                detection via success rate statistics is not performed for that host. Defaults
                to 100.
            success_rate_stdev_factor: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
                ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
                rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
                success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
                by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
                runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.
            timeout_sec: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                How many seconds to wait for the backend before considering it a
                failed request. Default is 30 seconds. Valid range is [1, 86400].
            tracking_mode: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the key used for connection tracking. There are two options:
                PER_CONNECTION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
                Connection Key (default Hash Method) for the specific protocol.
                PER_SESSION: The Connection Tracking is performed as per the
                configured Session Affinity. It matches the configured Session Affinity.
                Default value is PER_CONNECTION.
                Possible values are PER_CONNECTION and PER_SESSION.
            ttl: |-
                -
                (Optional, Beta)
                The TTL (in seconds) for which to cache responses with the corresponding status code. The maximum allowed value is 1800s
                (30 minutes), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

                Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
                After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
                provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
                snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).
                Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
                the disk.
                If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
                the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
                you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

                the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the
                first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
                characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
                character, which cannot be a dash.

                -
                (Optional)
                Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
                field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or
                sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
                persistent disk.
                If you specify this field along with sourceImage or sourceSnapshot,
                the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the sourceImage
                or the size of the snapshot.

                that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
                snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was

                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.

                -
                (Optional)
                In response to a matching path, the load balancer performs advanced routing
                actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
                request to the selected backend. If routeAction specifies any
                weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,
                routeAction cannot contain any  weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction
                or urlRedirect must be set.

                The list of ordered HTTP route rules. Use this list instead of pathRules when
                advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
                routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
                action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
                routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
                External load balancers.

                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time
                the request is has been fully processed (i.e. end-of-stream) up until the
                response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all retries. If not
                specified, the default value is 15 seconds.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: '- Default is 4 minutes.'
            url_redirect: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                When a path pattern is matched, the request is redirected to a URL specified
                by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or routeAction must not
                be set.
                Structure is documented below.

                -
                (Optional)
                The spec to modify the URL of the request, prior to forwarding the request to
                the matched service

            value: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The value of the label must match the specified value. value can have a maximum
                length of 1024 characters.
            weight: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as weight /
                (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) . The selection of a
                backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request has
                been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same
                backendService as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
                The value must be between 0 and 1000
            weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match
                occurs. The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their
                corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend
                service, there must be one  weightedBackendService with weight set to a non 0
                number. Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to
                the backend service, advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header
                transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this
                HttpRouteAction.

                For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                that matches the request is applied.
                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                2147483647 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                future without any impact on existing rules.

                -
                (Optional)
                In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer performs advanced routing
                actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the
                request to the selected backend. If  routeAction specifies any
                weightedBackendServices, service must not be set. Conversely if service is set,

                advanced route matching and routing actions are desired. The order of specifying
                routeRules matters: the first rule that matches will cause its specified routing
                action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
                routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for
                External load balancers.

                Specifies the fraction of traffic sent to backendService, computed as
                weight / (sum of all weightedBackendService weights in routeAction) .
                The selection of a backend service is determined only for new traffic. Once a user's request
                has been directed to a backendService, subsequent requests will be sent to the same backendService
                as determined by the BackendService's session affinity policy.
                The value must be between 0 and 1000
            weighted_backend_services: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route match occurs.
                The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service.
                If all traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService
                with weight set to a non 0 number.
                Once a backendService is identified and before forwarding the request to the backend service,
                advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on
                additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.

                Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
                For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
                "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
                grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
                grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
                gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
                Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
                Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
                project.

                the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its

                name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
                from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
                these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
                in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up

                (Required)
                One or more signatures over serializedPayload.
                Verifier implementations should consider this attestation
                message verified if at least one signature verifies

                - (Optional) Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance.
                The instance may be scheduled on the specified or newer CPU platform. Applicable
                values are the friendly names of CPU platforms, such as Intel Haswell. See the
                official documentation
                for more information.
            min_master_version: |-
                - (Optional) The minimum version of the master. GKE
                will auto-update the master to new versions, so this does not guarantee the
                current master version--use the read-only master_version field to obtain that.
                If unset, the cluster's version will be set by GKE to the version of the most recent
                official release (which is not necessarily the latest version).  Most users will find
                the google_container_engine_versions data source useful - it indicates which versions
                are available, and can be use to approximate fuzzy versions in a
                Terraform-compatible way. If you intend to specify versions manually,
                the docs
                describe the various acceptable formats for this field.
            minimum: '- (Optional) Minimum amount of the resource in the cluster.'
            mode: |-
                (Required) How to expose the node metadata to the workload running on the node.
                Accepted values are:
            monitoring_config: |-
                - (Optional) Monitoring configuration for the cluster.
                Structure is documented below.
            monitoring_service: |-
                - (Optional) The monitoring service that the cluster
                should write metrics to.
                Automatically send metrics from pods in the cluster to the Google Cloud Monitoring API.
                VM metrics will be collected by Google Compute Engine regardless of this setting
                Available options include
                monitoring.googleapis.com(Legacy Stackdriver), monitoring.googleapis.com/kubernetes(Stackdriver Kubernetes Engine Monitoring), and none.

                - (Optional) The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine
                network to which the cluster is connected. For Shared VPC, set this to the self link of the
                shared network.
            network_config: |-
                -  (Optional, Beta) Configuration for
                Adding Pod IP address ranges) to the node pool. Structure is documented below

                - (Optional) Whether we should enable the network policy addon
                for the master.  This must be enabled in order to enable network policy for the nodes.
                To enable this, you must also define a network_policy block,
                otherwise nothing will happen.
                It can only be disabled if the nodes already do not have network policies enabled.
                Defaults to disabled; set disabled = false to enable.
            networking_mode: |-
                - (Optional, [Beta]) Determines whether alias IPs or routes will be used for pod IPs in the cluster.
                Options are VPC_NATIVE or ROUTES. VPC_NATIVE enables IP aliasing,
                and requires the ip_allocation_policy block to be defined. By default when this field is unspecified, GKE will create a ROUTES-based cluster.
            node_config: |-
                -  (Optional) Parameters used in creating the default node pool.
                Generally, this field should not be used at the same time as a
                google_container_node_pool or a node_pool block; this configuration
                manages the default node pool, which isn't recommended to be used with
                Terraform. Structure is documented below.
            node_locations: |-
                - (Optional) The list of zones in which the cluster's nodes
                are located. Nodes must be in the region of their regional cluster or in the
                same region as their cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If this is specified for
                a zonal cluster, omit the cluster's zone.
            node_pool: |-
                - (Optional) List of node pools associated with this cluster.
                See google_container_node_pool for schema.
                Warning: node pools defined inside a cluster can't be changed (or added/removed) after
                cluster creation without deleting and recreating the entire cluster. Unless you absolutely need the ability
                to say "these are the only node pools associated with this cluster", use the
                google_container_node_pool resource instead of this property.
            node_version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version on the nodes. Must either be unset
                or set to the same value as min_master_version on create. Defaults to the default
                version set by GKE which is not necessarily the latest version. This only affects
                nodes in the default node pool. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.
                To update nodes in other node pools, use the version attribute on the node pool.
            notification_config: '- (Optional, Beta) Configuration for the cluster upgrade notifications feature. Structure is documented below.'
            oauth_scopes: |-
                - (Optional) The set of Google API scopes to be made available
                on all of the node VMs under the "default" service account.
                Use the "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" scope to grant access to all APIs. It is recommended that you set service_account to a non-default service account and grant IAM roles to that service account for only the resources that it needs.
            peering_name: '- The name of the peering between this cluster and the Google owned VPC.'
            pod_ipv4_cidr_block: '- (Optional, Beta) The IP address range for pod IPs in this node pool. Only applicable if createPodRange is true. Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. /14) to have a range chosen with a specific netmask. Set to a CIDR notation (e.g. 10.96.0.0/14) to pick a specific range to use.'
            pod_range: '- (Optional, Beta) The ID of the secondary range for pod IPs. If create_pod_range is true, this ID is used for the new range. If create_pod_range is false, uses an existing secondary range with this ID.'

                - (Optional, Beta) Configuration for the
                PodSecurityPolicy feature.

            private_ipv6_google_access: |-
                - (Optional)
                The desired state of IPv6 connectivity to Google Services. By default, no private IPv6 access to or from Google Services (all access will be via IPv4).
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
                is not provided, the provider project is used.

                - (Optional)
                Configuration options for the Release channel
                feature, which provide more control over automatic upgrades of your GKE clusters.
                When updating this field, GKE imposes specific version requirements. See
                Selecting a new release channel
                for more details; the google_container_engine_versions datasource can provide
                the default version for a channel. Note that removing the release_channel
                field from your config will cause Terraform to stop managing your cluster's
                release channel, but will not unenroll it. Instead, use the "UNSPECIFIED"
                channel. Structure is documented below.
            remove_default_node_pool: |-
                - (Optional) If true, deletes the default node
                pool upon cluster creation. If you're using google_container_node_pool
                resources with no default node pool, this should be set to true, alongside
                setting initial_node_count to at least 1.
            resource_labels: '- (Optional) The GCE resource labels (a map of key/value pairs) to be applied to the cluster.'
            resource_limits: |-
                - (Optional) Global constraints for machine resources in the
                cluster. Configuring the cpu and memory types is required if node
                auto-provisioning is enabled. These limits will apply to node pool autoscaling
                in addition to node auto-provisioning. Structure is documented below.
            resource_type: |-
                - (Required) The type of the resource. For example, cpu and
                memory.  See the guide to using Node Auto-Provisioning
                for a list of types.
            resource_usage_export_config: |-
                - (Optional) Configuration for the
                ResourceUsageExportConfig feature.
                Structure is documented below.
            sandbox_config: |-
                - (Optional, Beta) GKE Sandbox configuration. When enabling this feature you must specify image_type = "COS_CONTAINERD" and node_version = "1.12.7-gke.17" or later to use it.

                - The IP address range of the Kubernetes services in this
                cluster, in CIDR
                notation (e.g. 1.2.3.4/29). Service addresses are typically put in the last
                /16 from the container CIDR.
            services_ipv4_cidr_block: |-
                - (Optional) The IP address range of the services IPs in this cluster.
                Set to blank to have a range chosen with the default size. Set to /netmask (e.g. /14)
                to have a range chosen with a specific netmask. Set to a CIDR notation (e.g. 10.96.0.0/14)
                from the RFC-1918 private networks (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) to
                pick a specific range to use.
            services_secondary_range_name: |-
                - (Optional) The name of the existing
                secondary range in the cluster's subnetwork to use for service ClusterIPs.
                Alternatively, services_ipv4_cidr_block can be used to automatically create a
                GKE-managed one.
            shielded_instance_config: '- (Optional) Shielded Instance options. Structure is documented below.'
            state: '- (Required) ENCRYPTED or DECRYPTED'

                valid sources or targets for network firewalls.
            taint: |-
                - (Optional) A list of Kubernetes taints
                to apply to nodes. GKE's API can only set this field on cluster creation.
                However, GKE will add taints to your nodes if you enable certain features such
                as GPUs. If this field is set, any diffs on this field will cause Terraform to
                recreate the underlying resource. Taint values can be updated safely in
                Kubernetes (eg. through kubectl), and it's recommended that you do not use
                this field to manage taints. If you do, lifecycle.ignore_changes is
                recommended. Structure is documented below.
            topic: '(Optional) - The pubsub topic to push upgrade notifications to. Must be in the same project as the cluster. Must be in the format: projects/{project}/topics/{topic}.'
            tpu_ipv4_cidr_block: |-

                Note that this does not work on node pools which are "route-based" - that is, node
                pools belonging to clusters that do not have IP Aliasing enabled.
                See the official documentation
                for more information.
            max_surge: |-
                - (Required) The number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_surge raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded simultaneously.
                Can be set to 0 or greater.
            max_unavailable: |-
                - (Required) The number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable during
                an upgrade. Increasing max_unavailable raises the number of nodes that can be upgraded in
                parallel. Can be set to 0 or greater.
            min_node_count: |-
                - (Required) Minimum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be >=0 and
                <= max_node_count.
            name: |-
                - (Optional) The name of the node pool. If left blank, Terraform will
                auto-generate a unique name.
            name_prefix: |-
                - (Optional) Creates a unique name for the node pool beginning
                with the specified prefix. Conflicts with name.
            network_config: |-
                - (Optional) The network configuration of the pool. See
                google_container_cluster for schema.
            node_config: |-
                - (Optional) Parameters used in creating the node pool. See
                google_container_cluster for schema.
            node_count: |-
                - (Optional) The number of nodes per instance group. This field can be used to
                update the number of nodes per instance group but should not be used alongside autoscaling.
            node_locations: |-
                - (Optional)
                The list of zones in which the node pool's nodes should be located. Nodes must
                be in the region of their regional cluster or in the same region as their
                cluster's zone for zonal clusters. If unspecified, the cluster-level
                node_locations will be used.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which to create the node pool. If blank,
                the provider-configured project will be used.
            update: '- (Default 30 minutes) Used for updates to node pools'
            upgrade_settings: |-
                (Optional) Specify node upgrade settings to change how many nodes GKE attempts to
                upgrade at once. The number of nodes upgraded simultaneously is the sum of max_surge and max_unavailable.
                The maximum number of nodes upgraded simultaneously is limited to 20. Structure is documented below.
            version: |-
                - (Optional) The Kubernetes version for the nodes in this pool. Note that if this field
                and auto_upgrade are both specified, they will fight each other for what the node version should
                be, so setting both is highly discouraged. While a fuzzy version can be specified, it's
                recommended that you specify explicit versions as Terraform will see spurious diffs
                when fuzzy versions are used. See the google_container_engine_versions data source's
                version_prefix field to approximate fuzzy versions in a Terraform-compatible way.

                -
                (Optional)
                Pseudonymization method that generates deterministic encryption for the given input. Outputs a base64 encoded representation of the encrypted output. Uses AES-SIV based on the RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5297.

            crypto_replace_ffx_fpe_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in the content.reidentify API method, it serves the opposite function by reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context, the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate. Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization to learn more.
                Note: We recommend using CryptoDeterministicConfig for all use cases which do not require preserving the input alphabet space and size, plus warrant referential integrity.

                -
                (Optional)
                This is supported by mapping these to the alphanumeric characters that the FFX mode natively supports. This happens before/after encryption/decryption. Each character listed must appear only once. Number of characters must be in the range [2, 95]. This must be encoded as ASCII. The order of characters does not matter. The full list of allowed characters is:

                (Optional)
                Mask characters in reverse order. For example, if masking_character is 0, number_to_mask is 14, and reverse_order is false, then the
                input string 1234-5678-9012-3456 is masked as 00000000000000-3456.

                A string value.
            surrogate_info_type: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate
                For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc'
                This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType SurrogateType. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
                In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

                Its syntax (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) can be found under the google/re2 repository on GitHub.
            proximity: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Proximity of the finding within which the entire hotword must reside. The total length of the window cannot
                exceed 1000 characters. Note that the finding itself will be included in the window, so that hotwords may be
                used to match substrings of the finding itself. For example, the certainty of a phone number regex
                (\d{3}) \d{3}-\d{4} could be adjusted upwards if the area code is known to be the local area code of a company
                office using the hotword regex (xxx), where xxx is the area code in question.
                Structure is documented below.

            relative_likelihood: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
                if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
                then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
                Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
                adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
                will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                remove workers. A scale-down factor of 1 will result in scaling down so that there
                is no available memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
                A scale-down factor of 0 disables removing workers, which can be beneficial for
                autoscaling a single job.

                For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler must
                recommend at least a 2 worker scale-down for the cluster to scale. A threshold of 0
                means the autoscaler will scale down on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.
            scale_up_factor: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to
                add workers. A scale-up factor of 1.0 will result in scaling up so that there
                is no pending memory remaining after the update (more aggressive scaling).
                A scale-up factor closer to 0 will result in a smaller magnitude of scaling up
                (less aggressive scaling).
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0].
            scale_up_min_worker_fraction: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Minimum scale-up threshold as a fraction of total cluster size before scaling
                occurs. For example, in a 20-worker cluster, a threshold of 0.1 means the autoscaler
                must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of
                0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.
                Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.0.

                -
                (Optional)
                Describes how the autoscaler will operate for secondary workers.
                Structure is documented below.
            update: '- Default is 4 minutes.'
            weight: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Weight for the instance group, which is used to determine the fraction of total workers
                in the cluster from this instance group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2,
                and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers
                for each secondary worker.
                The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other
                autoscaling settings. For example, if maxInstances for secondary workers is 0, then only
                primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.
                If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for
                all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group
                within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight is set for one group only,
                the cluster will default to zero weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set
                only on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers only and no secondary workers.

                such as Hadoop jars, between client machines and the cluster.
                Note: If you don't explicitly specify a staging_bucket
                then GCP will auto create / assign one for you. However, you are not guaranteed
                an auto generated bucket which is solely dedicated to your cluster; it may be shared
                with other clusters in the same region/zone also choosing to use the auto generation
                option.
            subnetwork: |-
                - (Optional) The name or self_link of the Google Compute Engine

                - (Optional) The Cloud Storage temp bucket used to store ephemeral cluster
                and jobs data, such as Spark and MapReduce history files.
                Note: If you don't explicitly specify a temp_bucket then GCP will auto create / assign one for you.
            tgt_lifetime_hours: '- (Optional) The lifetime of the ticket granting ticket, in hours.'
            timeout_sec: |-
                - (Optional, Computed) The maximum duration (in seconds) which script is
                allowed to take to execute its action. GCP will default to a predetermined
                computed value if not set (currently 300).
            truststore_password_uri: |-
                - (Optional) The Cloud Storage URI of a KMS encrypted file
                containing the password to the user provided truststore. For the self-signed
                certificate, this password is generated by Dataproc.
            truststore_uri: |-
                - (Optional) The Cloud Storage URI of the truststore file used for
                SSL encryption. If not provided, Dataproc will provide a self-signed certificate.

            worker_config: |-
                (Optional) The Google Compute Engine config settings for the worker instances
                in a cluster. Structure defined below.
            zone: |-
                - (Optional, Computed) The GCP zone where your data is stored and used (i.e. where
                the master and the worker nodes will be created in). If region is set to 'global' (default)
                then zone is mandatory, otherwise GCP is able to make use of Auto Zone Placement
                to determine this automatically for you.
                Note: This setting additionally determines and restricts
                which computing resources are available for use with other configs such as
                cluster_config.master_config.machine_type and cluster_config.worker_config.machine_type.

                deployment. It can be updated to false to actually deploy
                with real resources.
                ~>NOTE: Deployment Manager does not allow update
                of a deployment in preview (unless updating to preview=false). Thus,
                Terraform will force-recreate deployments if either preview is updated
                to true or if other fields are updated while preview is true.

                -
                (Optional)
                A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
                They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
                Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.
                Structure is documented below.

                Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

                They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
                They are inherited by every page's [transition routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless of the current page. Transition routes defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.

                Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. Currently only default fallback intent is allowed in the agent, which is added upon agent creation.
                Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.

                The key/value metadata to label an intent. Labels can contain lowercase letters, digits and the symbols '-' and '_'. International characters are allowed, including letters from unicase alphabets. Keys must start with a letter. Keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and no more than 128 bytes.
                Prefix "sys-" is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys-head * sys-contextual The above labels do not require value. "sys-head" means the intent is a head intent. "sys.contextual" means the intent is a contextual intent.
                An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

                -
                (Required)
                The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase.
                Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does.
                Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated.
                If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
                If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
                Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.

                -
                (Optional)
                The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities.
                If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console.
                If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
            redact: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether the parameter content should be redacted in log. If redaction is enabled, the parameter content will be replaced by parameter name during logging.
                Note: the parameter content is subject to redaction if either parameter level redaction or entity type level redaction is enabled.
            repeat_count: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                may experience issues with this resource while updating. If you've defined a networks block and
                add another networks block while keeping the old block, Terraform will see an incorrect diff
                and apply an incorrect update to the resource. If you encounter this issue, remove all networks
                blocks in an update and then apply another update adding all of them back simultaneously.

                The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config.
                The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that
                are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient", "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given
                resource type, the server attempts to create one.
                See the streaming config reference for more details.

            disable_referential_integrity: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
                creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
                requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
                will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
                Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **
            disable_resource_versioning: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation
                of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical
                versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
                cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
                attempts to read the historical versions.

            enable_history_import: |-
                -

                Whether to allow the bulk import API to accept history bundles and directly insert historical resource
                versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have
                occurred in the past, which clients may not want to allow. If set to false, history bundles within an import
                will fail with an error.
                ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **

                Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability. This determines if the client can use an Update
                operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through
                the Create operation and attempts to Update a non-existent resource will return errors. Please treat the audit
                logs with appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain sensitive data such as patient
                identifiers, those IDs will be part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub
                notifications.

                The Cloud Pub/Sub topic that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
                PubsubMessage.Data will contain the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId is the ID of this message.
                It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
                was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a
                project. service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
                Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.
            recursive_structure_depth: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The depth for all recursive structures in the output analytics schema. For example, concept in the CodeSystem
                resource is a recursive structure; when the depth is 2, the CodeSystem table will have a column called
                concept.concept but not concept.concept.concept. If not specified or set to 0, the server will use the default
                value 2. The maximum depth allowed is 5.
            resource_types: |-
                -
                (Optional)

                https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-resource-types.html for a list of all FHIR resource types. The server treats
                an empty list as an intent to stream all the supported resource types in this FHIR store.
            schema_config: |-
                -

            stream_configs: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in
                this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next
                resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed
                from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required
                bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag (typically on
                the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.

                A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to
                record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction - EXTRACT(field) or
                REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which
                the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
                (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified
                log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an
                error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.

                (Optional)
                The approach to be used to combine
                time series. Not all reducer
                functions may be applied to all

                all members of a group of resources).When
                computing ratios, the aggregations and
                denominator_aggregations fields must use the
                same alignment period and produce time
                series that have the same periodicity and
                labels.This field is similar to the one in
                the MetricService.ListTimeSeries request. It
                is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries
                method when debugging this field.

            denominator_filter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A filter that identifies a time series that
                should be used as the denominator of a ratio
                that will be compared with the threshold. If
                a denominator_filter is specified, the time
                series specified by the filter field will be
                used as the numerator.The filter is similar
                to the one that is specified in the
                MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
                call is useful to verify the time series
                that will be retrieved / processed) and must
                specify the metric type and optionally may
                contain restrictions on resource type,
                resource labels, and metric labels. This
                field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
                in length.
            display_name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                A short name or phrase used to identify the
                condition in dashboards, notifications, and
                incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use the same
                display name for multiple conditions in the same
                policy.
            documentation: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Documentation that is included with notifications and incidents related
                to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation to include information
                to help responders understand, mitigate, escalate, and correct the underlying
                problems detected by the alerting policy. Notification channels that have
                limited capacity might not show this documentation.
                Structure is documented below.
            duration: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The amount of time that a time series must
                violate the threshold to be considered
                failing. Currently, only values that are a
                multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or
                300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid
                value is given, an error will be returned.
                When choosing a duration, it is useful to
                keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
                time series data (which may also be affected
                by any alignments specified in the
                aggregations field); a good duration is long
                enough so that a single outlier does not
                generate spurious alerts, but short enough
                that unhealthy states are detected and
                alerted on quickly.
            enabled: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether or not the policy is enabled. The default is true.

                A filter that identifies which time series
                should be compared with the threshold.The
                filter is similar to the one that is
                specified in the
                MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
                call is useful to verify the time series
                that will be retrieved / processed) and must
                specify the metric type and optionally may
                contain restrictions on resource type,
                resource labels, and metric labels. This
                field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
                in length.
            group_by_fields: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The set of fields to preserve when
                crossSeriesReducer is specified.
                The groupByFields determine how
                the time series are partitioned
                into subsets prior to applying the
                aggregation function. Each subset
                contains time series that have the
                same value for each of the
                grouping fields. Each individual
                time series is a member of exactly
                one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                is applied to each subset of time
                series. It is not possible to
                reduce across different resource
                types, so this field implicitly
                contains resource.type. Fields not
                specified in groupByFields are
                aggregated away. If groupByFields
                is not specified and all the time
                series have the same resource
                type, then the time series are
                aggregated into a single output
                time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                is not defined, this field is
                ignored.

                Identifies the notification channels to which notifications should be
                sent when incidents are opened or closed or when new violations occur
                on an already opened incident. Each element of this array corresponds
                to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel objects that are
                returned from the notificationChannels.list method. The syntax of the
                entries in this field is

                (Optional)
                The approach to be used to align
                individual time series. Not all
                alignment functions may be applied
                to all time series, depending on
                the metric type and value type of
                the original time series.
                Alignment may change the metric
                type or the value type of the time
                series.Time series data must be
                aligned in order to perform cross-
                time series reduction. If
                crossSeriesReducer is specified,
                then perSeriesAligner must be
                specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
                and alignmentPeriod must be
                specified; otherwise, an error is
                returned.

                the condition will trigger if the comparison
                is true for any of the time series that have
                been identified by filter and aggregations,
                or by the ratio, if denominator_filter and

                -
                (Optional)
                The sampling period of metric data points. For metrics which are written periodically, consecutive data points are stored at this time interval, excluding data loss due to errors. Metrics with a higher granularity have a smaller sampling period. In [duration format](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf?&_ga=2.264881487.1507873253.1593446723-935052455.1591817775#google.protobuf.Duration).
            type: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not URL-encoded. All service defined metrics must be prefixed with the service name, in the format of {service name}/{relative metric name}, such as cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/utilization. The relative metric name must have only upper and lower-case letters, digits, '/' and underscores '_' are allowed. Additionally, the maximum number of characters allowed for the relative_metric_name is 100. All user-defined metric types have the DNS name custom.googleapis.com, external.googleapis.com, or logging.googleapis.com/user/.
            unit: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the
                valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of
                the stored metric values.
                Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of
                0.02KBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as
                3.5MBy). However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in
                thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.
                If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job,
                you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently
                1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as
                12005.
                Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you
                can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value
                12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
                The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure standard.

                An optional human-readable description of this notification channel. This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.
            display_name: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
            enabled: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel at some point in the future.
            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}'
            labels: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The
                permissible and required labels are specified in the
                NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.
                Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore Terraform cannot
                determine if there are upstream changes to these fields. They can also be configured via
                the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.
            name: |-
                -
                The full REST resource name for this channel. The syntax is:
                projects/[PROJECT_ID]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
                The [CHANNEL_ID] is automatically assigned by the server on creation.
            password: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An password for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: webhook_basicauth
                Note: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            sensitive_labels: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the labels field on this
                resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
                sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
                in the labels map in the api request.
                Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
                to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.
                Structure is documented below.
            service_key: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                An servicekey token for a notification channel. Channel types that support this field include: pagerduty
                Note: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.
            type: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field. See https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list to get the list of valid values such as "email", "slack", etc...
            update: '- Default is 4 minutes.'
            user_labels: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field. This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin with a letter.
            verification_status: |-
                -
                Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

                (Required)
                Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
                Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
                destination location.
                Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
                location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
                endpoint from route information.
                If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
                multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
                destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
                interface.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
                is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
                don't intend to test.

                protocol is TCP or UDP.

                derived from the URI if you provide a VM instance or network URI.
                The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:

                -

                This is applicable to scenarios where a test can cross project
                boundaries.
            source: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.
                You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
                (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
                source location.
                Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
                a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
                also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
                which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
                information.
                If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
                you must provide the destination VPC network.
                If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
                network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
                identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
                address or VPC network.
                A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
                ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
                you don't intend to test.

            id: '- an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/{{name}}'
            labels: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache resource.
            max_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of the retryConditions.
                Once maxAttempts to this origin have failed the failoverOrigin will be used, if one is specified. That failoverOrigin may specify its own maxAttempts,
                retryConditions and failoverOrigin to control its own cache fill failures.
                The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four.
                The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with maxAttemptsTimeout.
                The last valid response from an origin will be returned to the client.
                If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 503 will be returned to the client.
                Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0 and less than 4.
            max_attempts_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum time across all connection attempts to the origin, including failover origins, before returning an error to the client. A HTTP 503 will be returned if the timeout is reached before a response is returned.
                Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 15s.
            name: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.
                The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match the regular expression [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]* which means the first character must be a letter,
                and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter or digit.
            origin_address: |-
                -
                (Required)
                A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
                This address will be used as the origin for cache requests - e.g. FQDN: media-backend.example.com IPv4:35.218.1.1 IPv6:[2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e] Cloud Storage: gs://bucketname
                When providing an FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public DNS) and IP addresses must be publicly routable.
                If a Cloud Storage bucket is provided, it must be in the canonical "gs://bucketname" format. Other forms, such as "storage.googleapis.com", will be rejected.
            port: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The port to connect to the origin on.
                Defaults to port 443 for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            protocol: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The protocol to use to connect to the configured origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use HTTP2 for both security & performance.
                When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must be presented by the origin server.
                Possible values are HTTP2, HTTPS, and HTTP.
            response_timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum duration to wait for data to arrive when reading from the HTTP connection/stream.
                Defaults to 5 seconds. The timeout must be a value between 1s and 30s.
            retry_conditions: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.
                If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s),
                the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.
                The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".
                retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s),
                which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.
                Valid values are:
            timeout: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The connection and HTTP timeout configuration for this origin.
                Structure is documented below.

                -
                (Optional)
                Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.
                By default, the CDNPolicy will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:

                of the original URL.
                pathTemplateMatch must be between 1 and 255 characters
                (inclusive).  The pattern specified by pathTemplateMatch may

                by pathTemplateRewrite.
                pathTemplateRewrite must be between 1 and 255 characters
                (inclusive), must start with a '/', and must only use variables
                captured by the route's pathTemplate matchers.
                pathTemplateRewrite may only be used when all of a route's

                You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 1 and 999 inclusive.
                Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers
                to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.

                -
                (Optional)
                Up to 10 PolicyRules are allowed. In Policies for boolean constraints, the following requirements apply: - There must be one and only one PolicyRule where condition is unset. - BooleanPolicyRules with conditions must set enforced to the opposite of the PolicyRule without a condition. - During policy evaluation, PolicyRules with conditions that are true for a target resource take precedence.

            disruption_budget: |-
                -
                (Required)
                The maximum number (or percentage) of VMs per zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up.
                During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps.
                A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
                For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone.
                For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.

            ack_deadline_seconds: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
                before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
                delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
                acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
                again during that time (on a best-effort basis).
                For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
                the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
                subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
                pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
                maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.
                For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
                for the call to the push endpoint.
                If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
                will eventually redeliver the message.
            attributes: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Endpoint configuration attributes.
                Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
                be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.
                The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
                can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
                attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
                the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
                (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
                based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.
                If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
                it will default to the version of the API used to make
                such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
                call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
                calls will always return a valid version, even if the
                subscription was created without this attribute.
                The possible values for this attribute are:
            audience: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Audience to be used when generating OIDC token. The audience claim
                identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. The audience
                value is a single case-sensitive string. Having multiple values (array)
                for the audience field is not supported. More info about the OIDC JWT
                token audience here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3
                Note: if not specified, the Push endpoint URL will be used.

            dead_letter_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
                this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
                is disabled.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
                parent project (i.e.,
                service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
                permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
                Structure is documented below.
            dead_letter_topic: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published.
                Format is projects/{project}/topics/{topic}.
                The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
                parent project (i.e.,
                service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
                permission to Publish() to this topic.
                The operation will fail if the topic does not exist.
                Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic
                since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
            delete: '- Default is 4 minutes.'
            enable_message_ordering: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If true, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
                the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
                may be delivered in any order.
            expiration_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
                A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
                is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
                operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
                policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
                resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
                is 1 day.
                Structure is documented below.
            filter: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
                Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
                by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
                you can't modify the filter.

                A set of key/value label pairs to assign to this Subscription.
            max_delivery_attempts: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be
                between 5 and 100.
                The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of
                NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message).
                A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
                client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.
                This field will be honored on a best effort basis.
                If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
            maximum_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 600 seconds.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".
            message_retention_duration: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
                backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
                retainAckedMessages is true, then this also configures the retention
                of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
                subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
                than 7 days ("604800s") or less than 10 minutes ("600s").
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
                by 's'. Example: "600.5s".
            minimum_backoff: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.

                -
                (Optional)
                If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as
                an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.
                Structure is documented below.
            project: |-
                - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
                If it is not provided, the provider project is used.
            push_config: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
                configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will
                pull and ack messages using API methods.
                Structure is documented below.
            push_endpoint: |-

                (Required)
                A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed.
                For example, a Webhook endpoint might use
                "https://example.com/push".
            retain_acked_messages: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then
                messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
                they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
                messageRetentionDuration window.
            retry_policy: |-
                -
                (Optional)
                A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.
                If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
                RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
                Structure is documented below.
            service_account_email: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Service account email to be used for generating the OIDC token.
                The caller (for subscriptions.create, subscriptions.patch, and
                subscriptions.modifyPushConfig RPCs) must have the
                iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission for the service account.
            topic: |-
                -
                (Required)
                A reference to a Topic resource.
            ttl: |-
                -
                (Required)
                Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The
                resource expires if it is not active for a period of ttl.
                If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires.
                A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
